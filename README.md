# bookin
simple app to create and filter bookings

Users without accounts can't create new bookings, only see the ones already created

# TODO

 - backend Rspec tests
 - Fix frontend Jest tests (jest config file is broken)
 - Page to create new spaces
 - Possibility for an user to edit/delete their own bookings
 - Frontend Form validations
 - Adopt Typescript (there were problems with babel)
